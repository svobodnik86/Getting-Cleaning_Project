# Getting-Cleaning_Project
repository containing course project for getting and cleaning data

This repository contains the script file project.R, clean data set activity_averages.txt, the codebook CodeBook.md

After downloading the initial files, the script should perform all the remaining analysis.
The zip file should be extracted in the project folder. Therefore in the project folder, 
there should be a directory called UCI HAR Dataset

The script is commented inside and most operations should be clear enough. 
Here in short:

1] reading raw data
2] merging of various data sets
3] read dplyr package to use it for several operations on data
4] use summarize on tidy data set to extract the analysis
5] write the file
